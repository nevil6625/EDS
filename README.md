EDS (Ensemble Defense System â€“ Hybrid IDS with SIEM)

The Ensemble Defense System (EDS) is a hybrid security framework that integrates multiple Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution.

The goal is to provide a stronger and more efficient defense against cyber threats by combining:

Signature-based IDS tools such as Zeek and Suricata

Behavior-based IDS tools such as Slips

Open-source SIEM (Elasticsearch & Kibana) for log management, analysis, and visualization

This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of each system to achieve better accuracy, reduce false positives, and improve detection capabilities.

################ Steps to Evaluate EDS ################################

#Clone this repository and unzip the files.
#Tested on Ubuntu, but feel free to experiment on other environments since the system runs in Docker containers.

cd eds -> cd EDS


#Update environment variables as needed:

nano .env


#After proper configuration, start the containers one by one.

Elasticsearch
docker-compose up -d elasticsearch
docker logs -f eds-elasticsearch-1


#Generate a service token:

curl -X POST --user elastic:changeme 0.0.0.0:9200/_security/service/elastic/kibana/credential/token/token1?pretty


#Add the generated key into the kibana section of your docker-compose.yml:

nano docker-compose.yml

#Kibana
docker-compose up -d kibana
docker logs -f eds-kibana-1

#Filebeat
docker-compose build --no-cache filebeat
docker-compose up -d filebeat
docker logs -f eds-filebeat-1

#Zeek
docker-compose build --no-cache zeek
docker-compose up -d zeek
docker logs -f eds-zeek-1

#Suricata
docker-compose build --no-cache suricata
docker-compose up -d suricata
docker logs -f eds-suricata-1

Note: Custom rules have been added in the suricata folder for detecting DoS attacks, SQL injections, and privilege escalation attempts. You can also create your own rules for detecting custom attacks.

#Slips
docker-compose build --no-cache slips
docker-compose up -d slips
docker logs -f eds-slips-1
